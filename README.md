# Number-Guessing-Game
The Number Guessing Game is an interactive C program where the player guesses a random number. Feedback is given for each guess: "Lower number, please" if too high, and "Higher number, please" if too low. The game displays the total attempts upon a correct guess, using loops and a random number generator for an engaging experience.
